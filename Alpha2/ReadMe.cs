        //The entire program is interactive, but it's really easy to play through, again, I did not want to make anything completely static.
        //    The Main classes are Biped, Alien, Protagonist, Vehicles, Equipment, Platoon, and Battle. They contain most of the methods which are mostly virtual, and the properties. The subclasses don't have too many of their own properties,
        //    because for the most part they are very similar, and the parent class incorporates those properties for a way to make it easier for the sub classes to inherit. The parent class methods also cover pretty much all of what the subclass methods would
        //    and the subclasses generally don't have a need to override them. There are many classes and I realized later on that I should have used a class library.
